# AI Model Evaluation Dashboard

This project is a demo app built to showcase how **@ionet**’s decentralized GPU network can power real-world AI use cases.  
The dashboard allows developers to evaluate AI models side by side in terms of speed, precision, and accuracy.



## Features

- Accepts text inputs for evaluation  
- Compare multiple AI models at the same time  
- Returns metrics on speed, precision, and accuracy  
- Provides backend endpoints for fetching available models and running evaluations  
- Built with Next.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend  
- Developer-friendly UI for quick testing  



## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js  
- Backend: Node.js + Express  
- Styling: TailwindCSS (optional)  
- APIs: Custom endpoints for model fetching and evaluation
